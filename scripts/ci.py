"""CI helpers for ttsproof, and a local runner for the workflow itself.

Every gate the GitHub workflow enforces lives here as a subcommand, so the
workflow file contains `python scripts/ci.py <gate>` and nothing clever. Two
consequences, both deliberate:

  * The gate can be run on a laptop before pushing, executing the same code the
    runner will execute - not a re-implementation of it.
  * `ci.py run` reads .github/workflows/ci.yml and executes the `run:` steps it
    finds there. The list of things to check is DERIVED from the workflow, never
    restated here. A step added to the workflow is picked up with no edit to
    this file; a step that stops working locally is visible before it is
    visible to a reviewer.

Exit codes follow ttsproof's own contract:

    0  the gate passed
    1  the gate failed - there is something to fix
    2  the gate could not be evaluated (network down, missing tool). This is
       never reported as a failure, because "I could not check" and "I checked
       and it is broken" are different facts.

Standard library only, except `ci.py run`, which needs PyYAML (a `dev` extra).
