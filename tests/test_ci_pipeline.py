"""The CI pipeline is a contract between three files that cannot see each other.

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` calls subcommands of `scripts/ci.py`; `release.yml`
reuses `ci.yml`; the test matrix has to agree with `requires-python` in
`pyproject.toml`. Nothing in Python or in GitHub Actions checks any of those
links - a renamed subcommand is a green pull request and a red tag, discovered
at the worst possible moment.

These tests are that check.
